                      We hold expertise in delivering BIM services for mixed-use buildings, shopping malls, theme parks, hospitals, airports, railways, residential townships, industrial plants and much more. Our highly experts BIM teams of architects, structural, civil and MEP engineers deliver efficient 3D plans and layouts along with as-built 3D model.
                      Our experienced BIM consultants and managers leverage Autodesk Revit to deliver virtual design and construction (VDC) solutions and 3D BIM coordinated models. We help contractors, architects, consultants, engineers and manufacturers by providing clash-free 3D BIM models according to IFC and COBie standards for design visualization and taking informed decisions.

                      As a BIM coordination company, the design inputs are first coordinated through the BIM model. Any design conflicts or inconsistencies in the inputs from different stakeholders are raised before any issues are seen on site. Clash free construction drawing sets are then worked upon which lead to swift time bound execution. The BIM model works as an unmatched tool for coordination and clash detection between components of different disciplines. We have experience on clash detection at all the Levels of development (LOD) on infrastructure projects and building.
